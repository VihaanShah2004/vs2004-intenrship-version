# VIDAVA AI Browser Extension - Intern Development Version

## ⚠️ Important Notice
**This is an intern development version of VIDAVA AI that has been significantly modified and customized for educational/demonstration purposes. This version is NOT the official VIDAVA AI product and should not be considered a complete or accurate representation of the final application. Many features have been simplified, modified, or implemented differently than the production version.**

## Overview
VIDAVA AI is a powerful browser extension that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to dynamically select the best credit card for online purchases, optimizing rewards and financial benefits in real time. This intern version demonstrates the core concepts and functionality, though the implementation may differ from the production system.

## Features (Intern Version)
- **Demo Card Selection**: Simplified AI/ML demonstration for recommending cards based on transaction type and basic patterns.
- **Basic Reward Calculation**: Demonstrates reward optimization using sample data and simplified algorithms.
- **Local Storage**: Uses browser localStorage instead of external databases for demonstration purposes.
- **Simplified ML Model**: Algorithm-based recommendation system for educational purposes.
- **Website Detection**: Basic website categorization for demo scenarios only.
- **Privacy-First Design**: All data stored locally, no external data transmission.

## Development Notes
- This version uses synthetic training data for the ML model
- Credit card data is simplified and for demonstration only
- Website detection is limited to demo scenarios
- No real financial data or external API integrations
- Authentication system has been simplified for demo purposes

## Getting Started (Intern Version)

### Installation
1. **Load Extension**: Load this as an unpacked extension in Chrome Developer Mode
2. **Demo Mode**: This version runs in demo mode with limited functionality

### Demo Setup
1. **No Account Required**: This version uses a default demo user
2. **Add Demo Cards**: Use the simplified card addition interface
3. **Test Recommendations**: Try the recommendation system with demo data

### Demo Features
- Add sample credit cards to your profile
- Get AI-powered recommendations for demo transactions
- View spending analysis with sample data
- Test the TensorFlow.js ML model with synthetic data

**Note**: This is for educational/demonstration purposes only. Do not use with real financial data.

## AI/ML Integration (Intern Version)

### How It Works (Demo Implementation)
- **Simplified Card Selection**: Basic algorithm that matches transaction categories with card reward rates
- **Synthetic Data Training**: ML model trained on generated data for demonstration purposes
- **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens in the browser using TensorFlow.js
- **Demo Learning**: Model learns from demo transactions and user interactions

### Privacy and Security (Intern Version)
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stored in browser localStorage, no external transmission
- **No Real Financial Data**: Uses only demo/synthetic data for all operations
- **Educational Purpose**: This version is for learning and demonstration only
  
## Key Benefits (Intern Version)
- **Educational Value**: Learn about AI/ML implementation in browser extensions
- **Demo Functionality**: Experience core concepts with simplified implementation
- **Local Processing**: Understand client-side machine learning with TensorFlow.js
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally without external data transmission

## Technical Implementation (Intern Version)

### Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow.js**: Browser-based machine learning
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: Manifest V3 implementation
- **Local Storage**: Browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external frameworks for simplicity

### Code Structure
