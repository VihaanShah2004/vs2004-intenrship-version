## Features (Intern Version)
- **Demo Card Selection**: Simplified AI/ML demonstration for recommending cards based on transaction type and basic patterns.
- **Basic Reward Calculation**: Demonstrates reward optimization using sample data and simplified algorithms.
- **Local Storage**: Uses browser localStorage instead of external databases for demonstration purposes.
- **TensorFlow.js Integration**: Browser-based machine learning model for educational purposes.
- **Website Detection**: Basic website categorization for demo scenarios only.
- **Privacy-First Design**: All data stored locally, no external data transmission.

## Development Notes
- This version uses synthetic training data for the ML model
- Credit card data is simplified and for demonstration only
- Website detection is limited to demo scenarios
- No real financial data or external API integrations
- Authentication system has been simplified for demo purposes
